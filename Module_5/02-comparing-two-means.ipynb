    "In the previous chapter we covered the situation when your outcome variable is nominal scale and your predictor variable[^note1] is also nominal scale. Lots of real world situations have that character, and so you'll find that chi-square tests in particular are quite widely used. However, you're much more likely to find yourself in a situation where your outcome variable is interval scale or higher, and what you're interested in is whether the average value of the outcome variable is higher in one group or another. For instance, a psychologist might want to know if anxiety levels are higher among parents than non-parents, or if working memory capacity is reduced by listening to music (relative to not listening to music). In a medical context, we might want to know if a new drug increases or decreases blood pressure. An agricultural scientist might want to know whether adding phosphorus to Australian native plants will kill them.[^note2] In all these situations, our outcome variable is a fairly continuous, interval or ratio scale variable; and our predictor is a binary \"grouping\" variable. In other words, we want to compare the means of the two groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard answer to the problem of comparing means is to use a $t$-test, of which there are several varieties depending on exactly what question you want to solve. As a consequence, the majority of this chapter focuses on different types of $t$-test: [one sample $t$-tests](onesamplettest), [student's](studentttest) and [welch's](welchttest), and [paired samples $t$-tests](pairedsamplesttest). After that, we'll talk a bit about [Cohen's $d$](cohensd), which is the standard measure of effect size for a $t$-test. The later sections of the chapter focus on the assumptions of the $t$-tests, and possible remedies if they are violated. However, before discussing any of these useful things, we'll start with a discussion of the $z$-test. \n",

Let's suppose that the average grade in his class is 67.5, and the standard deviation is 9.5. Of his many hundreds of students, it turns out that 20 of them also take psychology classes. Out of curiosity, I find myself wondering: do the psychology students tend to get the same grades as everyone else (i.e., mean 67.5) or do they tend to score higher or lower? He emails me the `zeppo.csv` file, which I use to pull up the `grades` of those students, "

In our example, that would mean we calculate $\\bar{X} - 67.5$.

If the null hypothesis is actually true, and the true mean is $\\mu_0$, then these facts together mean that we know the complete population distribution of the data: a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. Adopting the notation from Section \\@ref(normal), a statistician might write this as:\n",

(The reason for using this expanded notation is to help you remember that we're calculating standardised version of a sample mean, *not* a standardised version of a single observation, which is what a $z$-score usually refers to).

Better yet, regardless of what the population parameters for the raw scores actually are, the 5\\% critical regions for $z$-test are always the same, as illustrated in Figures \\@ref(fig:ztest1) and \\@ref(fig:ztest2).

    "At this point, we would traditionally look up the value 2.26 in our table of critical values. Our original hypothesis was two-sided (we didn't really have any theory about whether psych students would be better or worse at statistics than other students) so our hypothesis test is two-sided (or two-tailed) also. Looking at the little table that I showed earlier, we can see that 2.26 is bigger than the critical value of 1.96 that would be required to be significant at $\\alpha = .05$, but smaller than the value of 2.58 that would be required to be significant at a level of $\\alpha = .01$. Therefore, we can conclude that we have a significant effect, which we might write up by saying something like this:\n",

    "However, what if want an exact $p$-value? Well, back in the day, the tables of critical values were huge, and so you could look up your actual $z$-value, and find the smallest value of $\\alpha$ for which your data would be significant (which, as discussed earlier, is the very definition of a $p$-value). However, looking things up in books is tedious, and typing things into computers is awesome. So let's do it using Python instead. Now, notice that the $\\alpha$ level of a $z$-test (or any other test, for that matter) defines the total area \"under the curve\" for the critical region, right? That is, if we set $\\alpha = .05$ for a two-sided test, then the critical region is set up such that the area under the curve for the critical region is $.05$. And, for the $z$-test, the critical value of 1.96 is chosen that way because the area in the lower tail (i.e., below $-1.96$) is exactly $.025$ and the area under the upper tail (i.e., above $1.96$) is exactly $.025$. So, since our observed $z$-statistic is $2.26$, why not calculate the area under the curve below $-2.26$ or above $2.26$? In Python we can calculate this using the `NormalDist().cdf()` method.

    "\n",
    "As I've said before, all statistical tests make assumptions. Some tests make reasonable assumptions, while other tests do not. The test I've just described -- the one sample $z$-test -- makes three basic assumptions.  These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normality*. As usually described, the $z$-test assumes that the true population distribution is normal.[^note3] is often pretty reasonable, and not only that, it's an assumption that [we can check](shapiro-wilk) if we feel worried about it. \n",
    "- *Independence*. The second assumption of the test is that the observations in your data set are not correlated with each other, or related to each other in some funny way. This isn't as easy to check statistically: it relies a bit on good experimetal design. An obvious (and stupid) example of something that violates this assumption is a data set where you \"copy\" the same observation over and over again in your data file: so you end up with a massive \"sample size\", consisting of only one genuine observation. More realistically, you have to ask yourself if it's really plausible to imagine that each observation is a completely random sample from the population that you're interested in. In practice, this assumption is never met; but we try our best to design studies that minimise the problems of correlated data. \n",
    "- *Known standard deviation*. The third assumption of the $z$-test is that the true standard deviation of the population is known to the researcher. This is just stupid. In no real world data analysis problem do you know the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of some population, but are completely ignorant about the mean $\\mu$. In other words, this assumption is *always* wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the stupidity of assuming that $\\sigma$ is known, let's see if we can live without it. This takes us out of the dreary domain of the $z$-test, and into the magical kingdom of the $t$-test, with unicorns and fairies and leprechauns, and um..."

After all, if I'm entertaining the hypothesis that they don't have the same mean, then why should I believe that they absolutely have the same standard deviation? In view of this, I should really stop assuming that I know the true value of $\\sigma$. This violates the assumptions of my $z$-test, so in one sense I'm back to square one. However, it's not like I'm completely bereft of options. After all, I've still got my raw data, and those raw data give me an *estimate* of the population standard deviation: "

The obvious thing that you might think to do is run a $z$-test, but using the estimated standard deviation of 9.52 instead of relying on my assumption that the true standard deviation is 9.5. So, we could just type this new number into Python and out would come the answer. And you probably wouldn't be surprised to hear that this would still give us a significant result. This approach is close, but it's not *quite* correct. Because we are now relying on an *estimate* of the population standard deviation, we need to make some adjustment for the fact that we have some uncertainty about what the true population standard deviation actually is. Maybe our data are just a fluke ... maybe the true population standard deviation is 11, for instance. But if that were actually true, and we ran the $z$-test assuming $\\sigma=11$, then the result would end up being *non-significant*. That's a problem, and it's one we're going to have to address."

    "### Introducing the $t$-test\n",
    "\n",
    "This ambiguity is annoying, and it was resolved in 1908 by a guy called William Sealy Gosset {cite}`Student1908`, who was working as a chemist for the Guinness brewery at the time. Because Guinness took a dim view of its employees publishing statistical analysis (apparently they felt it was a trade secret), he published the work under the pseudonym \"A Student\", and to this day, the full name of the $t$-test is actually **_Student's $t$-test_**. The key thing that Gosset figured out is how we should accommodate the fact that we aren't completely sure what the true standard deviation is.[^note4] The answer is that it subtly changes the sampling distribution. In the $t$-test, our test statistic (now called a $t$-statistic) is calculated in exactly the same way I mentioned above. If our null hypothesis is that the true mean is $\\mu$, but our sample has mean $\\bar{X}$ and our estimate of the population standard deviation is $\\hat{\\sigma}$, then our $t$ statistic is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{N} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that has changed in the equation is that instead of using the known true value $\\sigma$, we use the estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}$. And if this estimate has been constructed from $N$ observations, then the sampling distribution turns into a $t$-distribution with $N-1$ **_degrees of freedom_** (df). The $t$ distribution is very similar to the normal distribution, but has \"heavier\" tails, as [discussed earlier](otherdists)  and illustrated in {numref}`fig-ttestdist`. Notice, though, that as df gets larger, the $t$-distribution starts to look identical to the standard normal distribution. This is as it should be: if you have a sample size of $N = 70,000,000$ then your \"estimate\" of the standard deviation would be pretty much perfect, right? So, you should expect that for large $N$, the $t$-test would behave exactly the same way as a $z$-test. And that's exactly what happens!  "

That is\n",

    "[^note_normality]: A technical comment... in the same way that we can weaken the assumptions of the $z$-test so that we're only talking about the sampling distribution, we *can* weaken the $t$ test assumptions so that we don't have to assume normality of the population. However, for the $t$-test, it's trickier to do this. As before, we can replace the assumption of population normality with an assumption that the sampling distribution of $\\bar{X}$ is normal. However, remember that we're also relying on a sample estimate of the standard deviation; and so we also require the sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\sigma}$ to be chi-square. That makes things nastier, and this version is rarely used in practice: fortunately, if the population is normal, then both of these two assumptions are met., and as noted earlier, there are [standard tools](shapiro) that you can use to check to see if this assumption is met, and [other tests](wilcox) you can do in it's place if this assumption is violated."

The original Student $t$-test -- which is the one I'll describe in this section -- is the simpler of the two, but relies on much more restrictive assumptions than the Welch $t$-test. Assuming for the moment that you want to run a two-sided test, the goal is to determine whether two \"independent samples\" of data are drawn from populations with the same mean (the null hypothesis) or different means (the alternative hypothesis). When we say \"independent\" samples, what we really mean here is that there's no special relationship between observations in the two samples. This probably doesn't make a lot of sense right now, but it will be clearer when we come to talk about the paired samples $t$-test later on. For now, let's just point out that if we have an experimental design where participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups, and we want to compare the two groups' mean performance on some outcome measure, then an independent samples $t$-test (rather than a paired samples $t$-test) is what we're after.\n",

Well we can use _the exact same function_ to run _all_ of the $t$-tests in this chapter. How's that for making things easier?

Since Dr Harpo sent the data to us in _long format_, that is, with all the grades in one column, and a second column telling us who the tutor was for each student, we will need to do something to break the grade data into two.

    "\n",
    "Before moving on to talk about the assumptions of the $t$-test, there's one additional point I want to make about the use of $t$-tests in practice. The first one relates to the sign of the $t$-statistic (that is, whether it is a positive number or a negative one).  One very common worry that students have when they start running their first $t$-test is that they often end up with negative values for the $t$-statistic, and don't know how to interpret it. In fact, it's not at all uncommon for two  people working independently to end up with Python outputs that are almost identical, except that one person has a negative $t$ values and the other one has a positive $t$ value. Assuming that  you're running a two-sided test, then the $p$-values will be identical. On closer inspection, the students will notice that the confidence intervals also have the opposite signs. This is perfectly okay: whenever this happens, what you'll find is that the two versions of the Python output arise from slightly different ways of running the $t$-test. What's happening here is very simple. The $t$-statistic that Python is calculating here is always of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\mbox{(mean 1)} -\\mbox{(mean 2)}}{ \\mbox{(SE)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If \"mean 1\" is larger than \"mean 2\" the $t$ statistic will be positive, whereas if \"mean 2\" is larger then the $t$ statistic will be negative. Similarly, the confidence interval that R reports is the confidence interval for the difference \"(mean 1) minus (mean 2)\", which will be the reverse of what you'd get if you were calculating the confidence interval for the difference \"(mean 2) minus (mean 1)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that's pretty straightforward when you think about it, but now consider our $t$-test comparing Anastasia's class to Bernadette's class. Which one should we call \"mean 1\" and which one should we call \"mean 2\". It's arbitrary. However, you really do need to designate one of them as \"mean 1\" and the other one as \"mean 2\". Not surprisingly, the way that Python handles this is also pretty arbitrary. In earlier versions of the book I used to try to explain it, but after a while I gave up, because it's not really all that important, and to be honest I can never remember myself. Whenever I get a significant $t$-test result, and I want to figure out which mean is the larger one, I don't try to figure it out by looking at the $t$-statistic. Why would I bother doing that? It's foolish. It's easier just look at the actual group means!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the important thing. Because it really doesn't matter what Python printed out, I usually try to *report* the $t$-statistic in such a way that the numbers match up with the text. Here's what I mean... suppose that what I want to write in my report is \"Anastasia's class had higher  grades than Bernadette's class\". The phrasing here implies that Anastasia's group comes first, so it makes sense to report the $t$-statistic as if Anastasia's class corresponded to group 1. If so, I would write \n",
    "\n",
    ">Anastasia's class had *higher* grades than Bernadette's class ($t(31)= 2.1, p=.04$). \n",
    "\n",
    "(I wouldn't actually emphasise the word \"higher\" in real life, I'm just doing it to emphasise the point that \"higher\" corresponds to positive $t$ values). On the other hand, suppose the phrasing I wanted to use has Bernadette's class listed first. If so, it makes more sense to treat her class as group 1, and if so, the write up looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bernadette's class had *lower* grades than Anastasia's class ($t(31)= -2.1, p=.04$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because I'm talking about one group having \"lower\" scores this time around, it is more sensible to use the negative form of the $t$-statistic. It just makes it read more cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing: please note that you *can't* do this for other types of test statistics. It works for $t$-tests, but it wouldn't be meaningful for  chi-square testsm $F$-tests or indeed for most of the tests I talk about in this book. So don't overgeneralise this advice! I'm really just talking about $t$-tests here and nothing else!"

    "As always, our hypothesis test relies on some assumptions. So what are they? For the Student t-test there are three assumptions, some of which we saw previously in the context of the one sample $t$-test (see Section \\@ref(ttestoneassumptions)):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normality*. Like the one-sample $t$-test, it is assumed that the data are normally distributed. Specifically, we assume that both groups are normally distributed. In Section \\@ref(shapiro) we'll discuss how to test for normality, and in Section \\@ref(wilcox) we'll discuss possible solutions.\n",
    "- *Independence*. Once again, it is assumed that the observations are independently sampled. In the context of the Student test this has two aspects to it. Firstly, we assume that the observations within each sample are independent of one another (exactly the same as for the one-sample test). However, we also assume that there are no cross-sample dependencies. If, for instance, it turns out that you included some participants in both experimental conditions of your study (e.g., by accidentally allowing the same person to sign up to different conditions), then there are some cross sample dependencies that you'd need to take into account.\n",
    "- *Homogeneity of variance* (also called \"homoscedasticity\"). The third assumption is that the population standard deviation is the same in both groups. You can test this assumption using the Levene test, which I'll talk about later on in the book (Section \\@ref(levene)). However, there's a very simple remedy for this assumption, which I'll talk about in the next section."

    "The biggest problem with using the Student test in practice is the third assumption listed in the previous section: it assumes that both groups have the same standard deviation. This is rarely true in real life: if two samples don't have the same means, why should we expect them to have the same standard deviation? There's really no reason to expect this assumption to be true. We'll talk a little bit about how you can check this assumption later on because it does crop up in a few different places, not just the $t$-test. But right now I'll talk about a different form of the $t$-test {cite}`Welch1947` that does not rely on this assumption. A graphical illustration of what the **_Welch $t$ test_** assumes about the data is shown in Figure {numref}`fig-ttesthyp2`, to provide a contrast with the Student test version in {numref}`fig-ttesthyp`. I'll admit it's a bit odd to talk about the cure before talking about the diagnosis, but as it happens the Welch test is often the default $t$-test, so this is probably the best place to discuss it. \n",

Is the sky burning? Probably not. The fact that one test is significant and the other isn't doesn't itself mean very much, especially since I kind of rigged the data so that this would happen. As a general rule, it's not a good idea to go out of your way to try to interpret or explain the difference between a $p$-value of .049 and a $p$-value of .051. If this sort of thing happens in real life, the *difference* in these $p$-values is almost certainly due to chance. What does matter is that you take a little bit of care in thinking about what test you use. The Student test and the Welch test have different strengths and weaknesses. If the two populations really do have equal variances, then the Student test is slightly more powerful (lower Type II error rate) than the Welch test. However, if they *don't* have the same variances, then the assumptions of the Student test are violated and you may not be able to trust it: you might end up with a higher Type I error rate.

In particular, a repeated measures design -- in which each participant is measured (with respect to the same outcome variable) in both experimental conditions -- is not suited for analysis using independent samples $t$-tests. For example, we might be interested in whether listening to music reduces people's working memory capacity. To that end, we could measure each person's working memory capacity in two conditions: with music, and without music.

This suggests that we should be looking at the *improvement* made by each student from one test to the next, and treating that as our raw data. To do this, we'll need to create a new variable for the `improvement` that each student makes, and add it to the data frame containing the `chico.csv` data.

    "In light of the previous exploration, let's think about how to construct an appropriate $t$ test. One possibility would be to try to run an independent samples $t$-test using `grade_test1` and `grade_test2` as the variables of interest. However, this is clearly the wrong thing to do: the independent samples $t$-test assumes that there is no particular relationship between the two samples. Yet clearly that's not true in this case, because of the repeated measures structure to the data. To use the language that I introduced in the last section, if we were to try to do an independent samples $t$-test, we would be conflating the **_within subject_** differences (which is what we're interested in testing) with the **_between subject_** variability (which we are not). \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem is obvious, I hope, since we already did all the hard work in the previous section. Instead of running an independent samples $t$-test on `grade_test1` and `grade_test2`, we run a *one-sample* $t$-test on the within-subject difference variable, `improvement`. To formalise this slightly, if $X_{i1}$ is the score that the $i$-th participant obtained on the first variable, and $X_{i2}$ is the score that the same person obtained on the second one, then the difference score is:\n",

Equally, we would say that $\\mu_D = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ is the population mean for this difference variable. So, to convert this to a hypothesis test, our null hypothesis is that this mean difference is zero; the alternative hypothesis is that it is not:\n",

    "When introducing the theory of null hypothesis tests, I mentioned that there are some situations [when it's appropriate to specify a *one-sided* test](one-two-sided). So far, all of the $t$-tests have been two-sided tests. For instance, when we specified a one sample $t$-test for the grades in Dr Zeppo's class, the null hypothesis was that the true mean was 67.5\\%. The alternative hypothesis was that the true mean was greater than *or* less than 67.5\\%. Suppose we were only interested in finding out if the true mean is greater than 67.5\\%, and have no interest whatsoever in testing to find out if the true mean is lower than 67.5\\%. If so, our null hypothesis would be that the true mean is 67.5\\% or less, and the alternative hypothesis would be that the true mean is greater than 67.5\\%. The `ttest()` function lets you do this, by specifying the `alternative` argument. If you set `alternative = 'greater'`, it means that you're testing to see if the true mean is larger than `mu`. If you set `alternative = 'less'`, then you're testing to see if the true mean is smaller than `mu`. To see how it would work for Dr Zeppo's class, let's compare the results of the two-sided test we did before with the results of a one-sided test, where the alternative hypothesis is set to \"greater\":"

The way that the $p$-value is calculated depends on those expectations, and they are the reason for choosing one test over the other.

As discussed by {cite}`McGrath2006`, there are several different version in common usage, and each author tends to adopt slightly different notation.

This can happen if, for instance, one of the two groups is a control group. Secondly, recall that in the usual calculation of the pooled standard deviation we divide by $N-2$ to correct for the bias in the sample variance; in one version of Cohen's $d$ this correction is omitted. Instead, we divide by $N$. This version makes sense primarily when you're trying to calculate the effect size in the sample; rather than estimating an effect size in the population. Finally, there is a version based on {cite}`Hedges1985`, who point out there is a small bias in the usual (pooled) estimation for Cohen's $d$.

    "\n",
    "All of the tests that we have discussed so far in this chapter have assumed that the data are normally distributed. This assumption is often quite reasonable, because the [central limit theorem](clt) does tend to ensure that many real world quantities are normally distributed: any time that you suspect that your variable is *actually* an average of lots of different things, there's a pretty good chance that it will be normally distributed; or at least close enough to normal that you can get away with using $t$-tests. However, life doesn't come with guarantees; and besides, there are lots of ways in which you can end up with variables that are highly non-normal. For example, any time you think that your variable is actually the minimum of lots of different things, there's a very good chance it will end up quite skewed. In psychology, response time (RT) data is a good example of this. If you suppose that there are lots of things that could trigger a response from a human participant, then the actual response will occur the first time one of these trigger events occurs.[^note13] This means that RT data are systematically non-normal.  Okay, so if normality is assumed by all the tests, and is mostly but not always satisfied (at least approximately) by real world data, how can we check the normality of a sample? In this section I discuss two methods: QQ plots, and the Shapiro-Wilk test."

This allows you to visually check whether you're seeing any systematic violations. In a QQ plot, each observation is plotted as a single dot. The x co-ordinate is the theoretical quantile that the observation should fall in, if the data were normally distributed (with mean and variance estimated from the sample) and on the y co-ordinate is the actual quantile of the data within the sample. If the data are normal, the dots should form a straight line. For instance, lets see what happens if we generate data by sampling from a normal distribution, and then drawing a QQ plot, using `probplot` from `scipy`.

    "Although QQ plots provide a nice way to informally check the normality of your data, sometimes you'll want to do something a bit more formal. And when that moment comes, the **_Shapiro-Wilk test_** {cite}`Shapiro1965` is probably what you're looking for.[^note14] As you'd expect, the null hypothesis being tested is that a set of $N$ observations is normally distributed. The test statistic that it calculates is conventionally denoted as $W$, and it's calculated as follows. First, we sort the observations in order of increasing size, and let $X_1$ be the smallest value in the sample, $X_2$ be the second smallest and so on. Then the value of $W$ is given by\n",

    "\n",
    "Because it's a little hard to explain the maths behind the $W$ statistic, a better idea is to give a broad brush description of how it behaves. Unlike most of the test statistics that we'll encounter in this book, it's actually *small* values of $W$ that indicated departure from normality. The $W$ statistic has a maximum value of 1, which arises when the data look \"perfectly normal\". The smaller the value of $W$, the less normal the data are. However, the sampling distribution for $W$  -- which is not one of the standard ones that I discussed in chapter on [probability](probability) and is in fact a complete pain in the arse to work with -- does depend on the sample size $N$. To give you a feel for what these sampling distributions look like, I've plotted three of them in {numref}`fig-swdist`. Notice that, as the sample size starts to get large, the sampling distribution becomes very tightly clumped up near $W=1$, and as a consequence, for larger samples $W$ doesn't have to be very much smaller than 1 in order for the test to be significant.

In fact, they don't make any assumptions about what kind of distribution is involved: in statistical jargon, this makes them **_nonparametric tests_**.

    "- A [paired samples $t$-test](pairedsamplesttest) is used when you have two scores from each person, and you want to test the null hypothesis that the two scores have the same mean. It is equivalent to taking the difference between the two scores for each person, and then running a one sample $t$-test on the difference scores.\n",

Australian natives are adapted to low phosphorus levels relative to everywhere else on Earth, apparently, so if you've bought a house with a bunch of exotics and you want to plant natives, don't follow my example: keep them separate. Nutrients to European plants are poison to Australian ones. There's probably a joke in that, but I can't figure out what it is.\n",

    "[^note3]: Actually this is too strong. Strictly speaking the $z$ test only requires that the sampling distribution of the mean be normally distributed; if the population is normal then it necessarily follows that the sampling distribution of the mean is also normal. However, as we saw when talking about the central limit theorem, it's quite possible (even commonplace) for the sampling distribution to be normal even if the population distribution itself is non-normal. However, in light of the sheer ridiculousness of the assumption that the true standard deviation is known, there really isn't much point in going into details on this front!\n",

    "[^note7]: A funny question almost always pops up at this point: what the heck *is* the population being referred to in this case? Is it the set of students actually taking Dr Harpo's class (all 33 of them)? The set of people who might take the class (an unknown number) of them? Or something else? Does it matter which of these we pick? It's traditional in an introductory behavioural stats class to mumble a lot at this point, but since I get asked this question every year by my students, I'll give a brief answer. Technically yes, it does matter: if you change your definition of what the \"real world\" population actually is, then the sampling distribution of your observed mean $\\bar{X}$ changes too. The $t$-test relies on an assumption that the observations are sampled at random from an infinitely large population; and to the extent that real life isn't like that, then the $t$-test can be wrong. In practice, however, this isn't usually a big deal: even though the assumption is almost always wrong, it doesn't lead to a lot of pathological behaviour from the test, so we tend to just ignore it.\n",

    "[^note10]: This design is very similar to the one in [](chisquare) that motivated the McNemar test. This should be no surprise. Both are standard repeated measures designs involving two measurements.

    "[^note13]: This is a massive oversimplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note14]: Either that, or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is probably more traditional than the Shapiro-Wilk, though most things I've read seem to suggest Shapiro-Wilk is the better test of normality, although Kolomogorov-Smirnov is a general purpose test of distributional equivalence, so it can be adapted to handle other kinds of distribution tests.\n",

    "[^note15]: Actually, there are two different versions of the test statistic; they differ from each other by a constant value. I'll just describe one of them here."
