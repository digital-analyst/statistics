    "This chapter introduces one of the most widely used tools in statistics, known as \"the analysis of variance\", which is usually referred to as ANOVA. The basic technique was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century, and it is to him that we owe the rather unfortunate terminology. The term ANOVA is a little misleading, in two respects. Firstly, although the name of the technique refers to variances, ANOVA is concerned with investigating differences in means. Secondly, there are several different things out there that are all referred to as ANOVAs, some of which have only a very tenuous connection to one another. Third (and this is Ethan speaking now) _everything_ in statistics is an analysis of variance: analyzing variance is the entire purpose of statistics, so it seems a little unfair to give that name to any particular test. I challenge you to show me any statistical procedure that is not, in some sense, an analysis of variance. Still, Fisher got there first, so what can you do? Later on in the book we'll encounter a range of different ANOVA methods that apply in quite different situations, but for the purposes of this chapter we'll only consider the simplest form of ANOVA, in which we have several different groups of observations, and we're interested in finding out whether those groups differ in terms of some outcome variable of interest. This is the question that is addressed by a **_one-way ANOVA_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this chapter is as follows: In [](anxifree) I'll introduce a fictitious data set that we'll use as a running example throughout the chapter. After introducing the data, I'll describe the mechanics of [how a one-way ANOVA actually works](anovaintro) and then focus on [how you can run one in Python](introduceaov). These two sections are the core of the chapter. The remainder of the chapter discusses a range of important topics that inevitably arise when running an ANOVA, namely [how to calculate effect sizes](etasquared), [post hoc tests and corrections for multiple comparisons](posthoc) and the [assumptions](anovaassumptions) that ANOVA relies upon. We'll also talk about how to check those assumptions and some of the things you can do if the assumptions are violated in the sections from [](levene) to [](kruskalwallis). At the end of the chapter we'll talk a little about the [relationship](anovaandt) between ANOVA and other statistical tools. "

    "Suppose you've become involved in a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant drug called *Joyzepam*. In order to construct a fair test of the drug's effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called *Anxifree*. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each drug: and the overall *improvement* in each person's mood is assessed on a scale ranging from $-5$ to $+5$. \n",

    "## How ANOVA works\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question posed by our clinical trial data, we're going to run a one-way ANOVA. As usual, I'm going to start by showing you how to do it the hard way, building the statistical tool from the ground up and showing you how you could do it in Python if you didn't have access to any of the cool ANOVA functions that kind people have made for us. And, as always, I hope you'll read it carefully, try to do it the long way once or twice to make sure you really understand how ANOVA works, and then -- once you've grasped the concept -- never *ever* do it this way again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental design that I described in the previous section strongly suggests that we're interested in comparing the average mood change for the three different drugs. In that sense, we're talking about an analysis similar to the [$t$-test](ttest), but involving more than two groups. If we let $\\mu_P$ denote the population mean for the mood change induced by the placebo, and let $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_J$ denote the corresponding means for our two drugs, Anxifree and Joyzepam, then the (somewhat pessimistic) null hypothesis that we want to test is that all three population means are identical: that is, *neither* of the two drugs is any more effective than a placebo. Mathematically, we write this null hypothesis like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "H_0 &:& \\mbox{it is true that } \\mu_P = \\mu_A = \\mu_J\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, our alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the three different treatments is different from the others. It's a little trickier to write this mathematically, because (as we'll discuss) there are quite a few different ways in which the null hypothesis can be false. So for now we'll just write the alternative hypothesis like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "H_1 &:& \\mbox{it is *not* true that } \\mu_P = \\mu_A = \\mu_J\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This null hypothesis is a lot trickier to test than any of the ones we've seen previously. How shall we do it? A sensible guess would be to \"do an ANOVA\", since that's the title of the chapter, but it's not particularly clear why an \"analysis of *variances*\" will help us learn anything useful about the *means*. In fact, this is one of the biggest conceptual difficulties that people have when first encountering ANOVA. To see how this works, I find it most helpful to start by talking about variances. In fact, what I'm going to do is start by playing some mathematical games with the formula that describes the variance. That is, we'll start out by playing around with variances, and it will turn out that this gives us a useful tool for investigating means."

    "### Two formulas for the variance of $Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's start by introducing some notation. We'll use $G$ to refer to the total number of groups. For our data set, there are three drugs, so there are $G=3$ groups. Next, we'll use $N$ to refer to the total sample size: there are a total of $N=18$ people in our data set. Similarly, let's use $N_k$ to denote the number of people in the $k$-th group. In our fake clinical trial, the sample size is $N_k = 6$ for all three groups.[^note1] Finally, we'll use $Y$ to denote the outcome variable: in our case, $Y$ refers to mood change. Specifically, we'll use $Y_{ik}$ to refer to the mood change experienced by the $i$-th member of the $k$-th group. Similarly, we'll use $\\bar{Y}$ to be the average mood change, taken across all 18 people in the experiment, and $\\bar{Y}_k$ to refer to the average mood change experienced by the 6 people in group $k$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent. Now that we've got our notation sorted out, we can start writing down formulas. To start with, let's recall the formula for the variance that we used in, way back in those [kinder days](var) when we were just doing descriptive statistics. The sample variance of $Y$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{Var}(Y) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^G \\sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \\left(Y_{ik} - \\bar{Y} \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula looks pretty much identical to the formula for the variance that we [used earlier](var) in the chapter on descriptive statistics. The only difference is that this time around I've got two summations here: I'm summing over groups (i.e., values for $k$) and over the people within the groups (i.e., values for $i$). This is purely a cosmetic detail: if I'd instead used the notation $Y_p$ to refer to the value of the outcome variable for person $p$ in the sample, then I'd only have a single summation. The only reason that we have a double summation here is that I've classified people into groups, and then assigned numbers to people within groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete example might be useful here. Let's consider this table, in which we have a total of $N=5$ people sorted into $G=2$ groups. Arbitrarily, let's say that the \"cool\" people are group 1, and the \"uncool\" people are group 2, and it turns out that we have three cool people ($N_1 = 3$) and two uncool people ($N_2 = 2$)."

We have a \"person\" variable $p$, so it would be perfectly sensible to refer to $Y_p$ as the grumpiness of the $p$-th person in the sample. For instance, the table shows that Dan is the fourth person, so we'd say $p = 4$. So, when talking about the grumpiness $Y$ of this \"Dan\" person, whoever they might be, we could refer to Dan's grumpiness by saying that $Y_p = 91$, for person $p = 4$ that is.  However, that's not the only way we could refer to Dan. As an alternative, we could note that Dan belongs to the \"uncool\" group ($k = 2$), and is in fact the first person listed in the uncool group ($i = 1$). So it's equally valid to refer to Dan's grumpiness by saying that $Y_{ik} = 91$, where $k = 2$ and $i = 1$. In other words, each person $p$ corresponds to a unique $ik$ combination, and so the formula that I gave above is actually identical to our original formula for the variance, which would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{Var}(Y) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{p=1}^N  \\left(Y_{p} - \\bar{Y} \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In both formulas, all we're doing is summing over all of the observations in the sample. Most of the time we would just use the simpler $Y_p$ notation: the equation using $Y_p$ is clearly the simpler of the two. However, when doing an ANOVA it's important to keep track of which participants belong in which groups, and we need to use the $Y_{ik}$ notation to do this. "

    "### From variances to sums of squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now that we've got a good grasp on how the variance is calculated, let's define something called the **_total sum of squares_**, which is denoted SS$_{tot}$. This is very simple: instead of averaging the squared deviations, which is what we do when calculating the variance, we just add them up. So the formula for the total sum of squares is almost identical to the formula for the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{SS}_{tot} = \\sum_{k=1}^G \\sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \\left(Y_{ik} - \\bar{Y} \\right)^2\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about analysing variances in the context of ANOVA, what we're really doing is working with the total sums of squares rather than the actual variance. One very nice thing about the total sum of squares is that we can break it up into two different kinds of variation. Firstly, we can talk about the **_within-group sum of squares_**, in which we look to see how different each individual person is from their own group mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{SS}_w = \\sum_{k=1}^G \\sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \\left( Y_{ik} - \\bar{Y}_k \\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{Y}_k$ is a group mean. In our example, $\\bar{Y}_k$ would be the average mood change experienced by those people given  the $k$-th drug. So, instead of comparing individuals to the average of *all* people in the experiment, we're only comparing them to those people in the the same group. As a consequence, you'd expect the value of $\\mbox{SS}_w$ to be smaller than the total sum of squares, because it's completely ignoring any group differences -- that is, the fact that the drugs (if they work) will have different effects on people's moods.\n",
    " \n",
    "Next, we can define a third notion of variation which captures *only* the differences between groups. We do this by looking at the differences between the group means $\\bar{Y}_k$ and grand mean $\\bar{Y}$. In order to quantify the extent of this variation, what we do is calculate the **_between-group sum of squares_**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "\\mbox{SS}_{b} &=& \\sum_{k=1}^G \\sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \\left( \\bar{Y}_k - \\bar{Y} \\right)^2\n",
    " \\\\\n",
    "&=& \\sum_{k=1}^G N_k \\left( \\bar{Y}_k - \\bar{Y} \\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not too difficult to show that the total variation among people in the experiment $\\mbox{SS}_{tot}$ is actually the sum of the differences between the groups $\\mbox{SS}_b$ and the variation inside the groups $\\mbox{SS}_w$. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{SS}_w  + \\mbox{SS}_{b} = \\mbox{SS}_{tot}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Okay, so what have we found out? We've discovered that the total variability associated with the outcome variable ($\\mbox{SS}_{tot}$) can be mathematically carved up into the sum of \"the variation due to the differences in the sample means for the different groups\" ($\\mbox{SS}_{b}$) plus \"all the rest of the variation\" ($\\mbox{SS}_{w}$). How does that help me find out whether the groups have different population means? Um. Wait. Hold on a second... now that I think about it, this is *exactly* what we were looking for. If the null hypothesis is true, then you'd expect all the sample means to be pretty similar to each other, right? And that would imply that you'd expect $\\mbox{SS}_{b}$ to be really small, or at least you'd expect it to be a lot smaller than the \"the variation associated with everything else\", $\\mbox{SS}_{w}$. Hm. I detect a hypothesis test coming on...\n",
    "\n",
    "### From sums of squares to the $F$-test\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the last section, the *qualitative* idea behind ANOVA is to compare the two sums of squares values $\\mbox{SS}_b$ and $\\mbox{SS}_w$ to each other: if the between-group variation is $\\mbox{SS}_b$ is large relative to the within-group variation $\\mbox{SS}_w$ then we have reason to suspect that the population means for the different groups aren't identical to each other. In order to convert this into a workable hypothesis test, there's a little bit of \"fiddling around\" needed. What I'll do is first show you *what* we do to calculate our test statistic -- which is called an **_$F$ ratio_** -- and then try to give you a feel for *why* we do it this way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to convert our SS values into an $F$-ratio, the first thing we need to calculate is the **_degrees of freedom_** associated with the SS$_b$ and SS$_w$ values. As usual, the degrees of freedom corresponds to the number of unique \"data points\" that contribute to a particular calculation, minus the number of \"constraints\" that they need to satisfy. For the within-groups variability, what we're calculating is the variation of the individual observations ($N$ data points) around the group means ($G$ constraints). In contrast, for the between groups variability, we're interested in the variation of the group means ($G$ data points) around the grand mean (1 constraint). Therefore, the degrees of freedom here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lcl}\n",
    "\\mbox{df}_b &=& G-1 \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{df}_w &=& N-G \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that seems simple enough. What we do next is convert our summed squares value into a \"mean squares\" value, which we do by dividing by the degrees of freedom: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lcl}\n",
    "\\mbox{MS}_b &=& \\displaystyle\\frac{\\mbox{SS}_b }{ \\mbox{df}_b} \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{MS}_w &=& \\displaystyle\\frac{\\mbox{SS}_w }{ \\mbox{df}_w} \n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we calculate the $F$-ratio by dividing the between-groups MS by the within-groups MS:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\mbox{MS}_b }{ \\mbox{MS}_w } \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very general level, the intuition behind the $F$ statistic is straightforward: bigger values of $F$ means that the between-groups variation is large, relative to the within-groups variation. As a consequence, the larger the value of $F$, the more evidence we have against the null hypothesis. But how large does $F$ have to be in order to actually *reject* $H_0$? In order to understand this, you need a slightly deeper understanding of what ANOVA is and what the mean squares values actually are. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next section discusses that in a bit of detail, but for readers that aren't interested in the details of what the test is actually measuring, I'll cut to the chase. In order to complete our hypothesis test, we need to know the sampling distribution for $F$ if the null hypothesis is true. Not surprisingly, the sampling distribution for the $F$ *statistic* under the null hypothesis is an $F$ *distribution*. If you recall back to our discussion of the $F$ distribution in [](probability), the $F$ distribution has two parameters, corresponding to the two degrees of freedom involved: the first one df$_1$ is the between groups degrees of freedom df$_b$, and the second one df$_2$ is the within groups degrees of freedom df$_w$. \n",

    "### The model for the data and the meaning of $F$ (advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "At a fundamental level, ANOVA is a competition between two different statistical models, $H_0$ and $H_1$. When I described the null and alternative hypotheses at the start of the section, I was a little imprecise about what these models actually are. I'll remedy that now, though you probably won't like me for doing so. If you recall, our null hypothesis was that all of the group means are identical to one another. If so, then a natural way to think about the outcome variable $Y_{ik}$ is to describe individual scores in terms of a single population mean $\\mu$, plus the deviation from that population mean. This deviation is usually denoted $\\epsilon_{ik}$ and is traditionally called the *error* or **_residual_** associated with that observation. Be careful though: just like we saw with the word \"significant\", the word \"error\" has a technical meaning in statistics that isn't quite the same as its everyday English definition. In everyday language, \"error\" implies a mistake of some kind; in statistics, it doesn't (or at least, not necessarily). With that in mind, the word \"residual\" is a better term than the word \"error\". In statistics, both words mean \"leftover variability\": that is, \"stuff\" that the model can't explain. In any case, here's what the null hypothesis looks like when we write it as a statistical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{ik} = \\mu + \\epsilon_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we make the *assumption* (discussed later) that the residual values $\\epsilon_{ik}$ are normally distributed, with mean 0 and a standard deviation $\\sigma$ that is the same for all groups. To use the notation that we introduced in the [chapter on probability](probability) we would write this assumption like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ik} \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(0, \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$? The only difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is that we allow each group to have a different population mean. So, if we let $\\mu_k$ denote the population mean for the $k$-th group in our experiment, then the statistical model corresponding to $H_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{ik} = \\mu_k + \\epsilon_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, once again, we assume that the error terms are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sigma$. That is, the alternative hypothesis also assumes that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ik} \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(0, \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now that we've described the statistical models underpinning $H_0$ and $H_1$ in more detail, it's now pretty straightforward to say what the mean square values are measuring, and what this means for the interpretation of $F$. I won't bore you with the proof of this, but it turns out that the within-groups mean square, MS$_w$, can be viewed as an estimator (in the technical sense: [estimation](estimation) of the error variance $\\sigma^2$.  The between-groups mean square MS$_b$ is also an estimator; but what it estimates is the error variance *plus* a quantity that depends on the true differences among the group means. If we call this quantity $Q$, then we can see that the $F$-statistic is basically [^note2]\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\hat{Q} + \\hat\\sigma^2}{\\hat\\sigma^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the true value $Q=0$ if the null hypothesis is true, and $Q > 0$ if the alternative hypothesis is true (if you must know more, than check out chapter 10 of {cite}`Hays1994`). Therefore, at a bare minimum *the $F$ value must be larger than 1* to have any chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Note that this *doesn't* mean that it's impossible to get an $F$-value less than 1. What it means is that, if the null hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of the $F$ ratio has a mean of 1,[^note3] and so we need to see $F$-values larger than 1 in order to safely reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a bit more precise about the sampling distribution, notice that if the null hypothesis is true, both MS$_b$ and MS$_w$ are estimators of the variance of the residuals $\\epsilon_{ik}$. If those residuals are normally distributed, then you might suspect that the estimate of the variance of $\\epsilon_{ik}$ is chi-square distributed... because (as discussed [much earlier](otherdists)) that's what a chi-square distribution *is*: it's what you get when you square a bunch of normally-distributed things and add them up. And since the $F$ distribution is (again, by definition) what you get when you take the ratio between two things that are $\\chi^2$ distributed... we have our sampling distribution. Obviously, I'm glossing over a whole lot of stuff when I say this, but in broad terms, this really is where our sampling distribution comes from."

    "The previous discussion was fairly abstract, and a little on the technical side, so I think that at this point it might be useful to see a worked example. For that, let's go back to the clinical trial data that I introduced at the start of the chapter. The descriptive statistics that we calculated at the beginning tell us our group means: an average mood gain of 0.45 for the placebo, 0.72 for Anxifree, and 1.48 for Joyzepam. With that in mind, let's party like it's 1899 [^note4] and  start doing some pencil and paper calculations. I'll only do this for the first 5 observations, because it's not bloody 1899 and I'm very lazy. Let's start by calculating $\\mbox{SS}_{w}$, the within-group sums of squares. First, let's draw up a nice table to help us with our calculations... "

There's quite a lot of calculations that we needed to do along the way, and it would be tedious to have to do this over and over again every time you wanted to do an ANOVA. One possible solution to the problem would be to take all these calculations and turn them into some Python functions yourself. You'd still have to do a lot of typing, but at least you'd only have to do it the one time: once you've created the functions, you can reuse them over and over again.

    "### Getting Python to calculate ANOVA for you\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you can imagine, there are several Python modules available that provided tools for taking the pain out calculating ANOVA's. `scipy`, for example, has `stats.f_oneway` which, in the typical, laconic fashion of `scipy`, spits out an $F$-value, a $p$-value, and not much more. We have already used `scipy.stats` above to find our $p$-value by hand. I am going to reccomend an entirely different package, though: `statsmodels`. These things go in and out of fashion, but for my money, `statsmodels` is quickly becoming the go-to Python package for anthing beyond a humble $t$-test. `statsmodels` builds on a more modern approach to statistics which goes beyond what we can deal with here, but suffice to say, that among other things, it is an easy way to get your ANOVA work done. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to working with `statsmodels` is the `formula`, so let's take a look at that. A `statsmodels` formula (which will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has worked with the programming language R before) begins with the _dependent variable_ or _outcome measure_: basically the thing we are trying to undersand. The _outcome measure_ goes on the left side of the `~`character, which I read in my head as \"predicted by\". To the right of the `~` comes, unsurprisingly, the _predictor variables_, or _independent variables_ if you prefer. So, in our case, we are investigating whether or not there are significant differences between the three drug types: placebo, anxifree, and joyzepam. In other words, we want to know if variation in the variable `mood_gain` that can be accounted for by these three groups is greater than the variation within the groups. Or, in still other words, whether `mood_gain` can be _predicted by_ `drug`. So, our formula is `'mood_gain ~ drug'`.\n",

    "Once we get done celebrating, we might take a little closer look at this wonder function. The function is called `anova_lm`. The ANOVA part makes sense, sure, but what is this `lm` thing all about? `lm` stands for \"linear model\", and later on, we'll see that this reflects a pretty deep statistical relationship between ANOVA and [linear regression](regression), and this has some important implications for what can be done with both ANOVAs and linear regressions... but I'm getting ahead of myself. For now, let's just bask in the glory of the anova table that `statsmodels` gives us. We get the sums of squares, the degrees of freedom, the $F$-statistic, and the $p$-value itself. These are all identical to the numbers that we calculated ourselves when doing it the long and tedious way, and it's even organised into a nice table, like the [one that we filled out by hand](onewayanovatable). You might be wondering what the ``NaN``s in the last two cells are. If you compare this table to the [one that we filled out by hand](onewayanovatable), you will see that these are simply empty cells; it doesn't make sense to calculate an $F$-value or $p$-value for the residuals. ``NaN`` just means \"not a number\". It would be nicer if ``statsmodels`` just left these cells empty, but after all the work it has just done for us, I'm willing to overlook this.\n",

    "There's a few different ways you could measure the effect size in an ANOVA, but the most commonly used measures are $\\eta^2$ (**_eta squared_**) and partial $\\eta^2$. For a one way analysis of variance they're identical to each other, so for the moment I'll just explain $\\eta^2$. The definition of $\\eta^2$ is actually really simple:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "The interpretation of $\\eta^2$ is equally straightforward: it refers to the proportion of the variability in the outcome variable (`mood_gain`) that can be explained in terms of the predictor (`drug`). A value of $\\eta^2 = 0$ means that there is no relationship at all between the two, whereas a value of $\\eta^2 = 1$ means that the relationship is perfect. Better yet, the $\\eta^2$ value is very closely related to a squared correlation (i.e., $r^2$). So, if you're trying to figure out whether a particular value of $\\eta^2$ is big or small, it's sometimes useful to remember that \n",

If we think about this as being equivalent to a correlation of about .84, we'd conclude that the relationship between `drug` and `mood_gain` is strong. \n",

    "Any time you run an ANOVA with more than two groups, and you end up with a significant effect, the first thing you'll probably want to ask is which groups are actually different from one another. In our drugs example, our null hypothesis was that all three drugs (placebo, Anxifree and Joyzepam) have the exact same effect on mood. But if you think about it, the null hypothesis is actually claiming *three* different things all at once here. Specifically, it claims that:\n",

    "- Your drug (Joyzepam) is no better than a placebo (i.e., $\\mu_J = \\mu_P$)\n",
    "- Anxifree and Joyzepam are equally effective (i.e., $\\mu_J = \\mu_A$)\n",
    "\n",
    "If any one of those three claims is false, then the null hypothesis is also false. So, now that we've rejected our null hypothesis, we're thinking that *at least* one of those things isn't true. But which ones? All three of these propositions are of interest: you certainly want to know if your new drug Joyzepam is better than a placebo, and it would be nice to know how well it stacks up against an existing commercial alternative (i.e., Anxifree). It would even be useful to check the performance of Anxifree against the placebo: even if Anxifree has already been extensively tested against placebos by other researchers, it can still be very useful to check that your study is producing similar results to earlier work.\n",

Given that we've got three separate pairs of means (placebo versus Anxifree, placebo versus Joyzepam, and Anxifree versus Joyzepam) to compare, what we could do is run three separate $t$-tests and see what happens. There's a couple of ways that we could do this. One method would be to construct new variables corresponding the groups you want to compare (e.g., `anxifree`, `placebo` and `joyzepam`), and then run a $t$-test on these new variables."

    "This \"lots of $t$-tests idea\" isn't a bad strategy, but there is a problem with just running lots and lots of $t$-tests. The concern is that when running these analyses, what we're doing is going on a \"fishing expedition\": we're running lots and lots of tests without much theoretical guidance, in the hope that some of them come up significant. This kind of theory-free search for group differences is referred to as **_post hoc analysis_** (\"post hoc\" being Latin for \"after this\").[^plannedcomparisons]   \n",
    "\n",
    "It's okay to run post hoc analyses, but a lot of care is required, because post-hoc t-tests can be pretty dangerous: each *individual* $t$-test is designed to have a 5\\% Type I error rate (i.e., $\\alpha = .05$), but imagine if I ran three of these tests. Intuitively, you may be able to feel that if every test I do has a 5\\% chance of committing a Type I error, then the more tests I do on the same set of data, the more likely that at least _some_ of them will lead me to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. \n",

    "$$FWER = 1-(1-\\alpha)^m$$\n",

    "where $m$ is the number of tests I do. So, while we might feel fine about choosing an $\\alpha$ of 0.05 for one $t$-test, which gives us a 5\\% chance of committing a Type I error, we might not feel so hot about running three post-hoc $t$-tests on our data, since \n",

    "The usual solution to this problem is to introduce an adjustment to the $p$-value, which aims to control the total error rate across the family of tests (see {cite}`Shaffer1995`). An adjustment of this form, which is usually (but not always) applied because one is doing post hoc analysis, is often referred to as a **_correction for multiple comparisons_**, though it is sometimes referred to as \"simultaneous inference\". In any case, there are quite a few different ways of doing this adjustment. I'll discuss a few of them in this section and in [a later section](posthoc2), but you should be aware that there are many other methods out there (see, e.g., {cite}`Hsu1996`). \n",

    "The simplest of these adjustments is called the **_Bonferroni correction_** {cite}`Dunn1961`, and it's very very simple indeed. Suppose that my post hoc analysis consists of $m$ separate tests, and I want to ensure that the total probability of making *any* Type I errors at all is at most $\\alpha$.[^bonf] If so, then the Bonferroni correction just says \"multiply all your raw $p$-values by $m$\". If we let $p$ denote the original $p$-value, and let $p^\\prime_j$ be the corrected value, then the Bonferroni correction tells that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p^\\prime = m \\times p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And therefore, if you're using the Bonferroni correction, you would reject the null hypothesis if $p^\\prime < \\alpha$. The logic behind this correction is very straightforward. We're doing $m$ different tests; so if we arrange it so that each test has a Type I error rate of at most $\\alpha / m$, then the *total* Type I error rate across these tests cannot be larger than $\\alpha$. That's pretty simple, so much so that in the original paper, the author writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The method given here is so simple and so general that I am sure it must have been used before this. I do not find it, however, so can only conclude that perhaps its very simplicity has kept statisticians from realizing that it is a very good method in some situations (pp 52-53 {cite}`Dunn1961`)"

    "### Holm corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Bonferroni correction is the simplest adjustment out there, it's not usually the best one to use. One method that is often used instead is the **_Holm correction_** {cite}`Holm1979`. The idea behind the Holm correction is to pretend that you're doing the tests sequentially; starting with the smallest (raw) $p$-value and moving onto the largest one. For the $j$-th largest of the $p$-values, the adjustment is *either*\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whichever one is *larger*. This might sound a little confusing, so let's go through it a little more slowly. Here's what the Holm correction does. First, you sort all of your $p$-values in order, from smallest to largest. For the smallest $p$-value all you do is multiply it by $m$, and you're done. However, for all the other ones it's a two-stage process. For instance, when you move to the second smallest $p$ value, you first multiply it by $m-1$. If this produces a number that is bigger than the adjusted $p$-value that you got last time, then you keep it. But if it's smaller than the last one, then you copy the last $p$-value. To illustrate how this works, consider the table below, which shows the calculations of a Holm correction for a collection of five $p$-values:\n",

    "## Assumptions of one-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any statistical test, analysis of variance relies on some assumptions about the data. There are three key assumptions that you need to be aware of: *normality*, *homogeneity of variance* and *independence*. If you remember back to [this section](anovamodel) -- which I hope you at least skimmed even if you didn't read the whole thing -- I described the statistical models underpinning ANOVA, which I wrote down like this:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these equations $\\mu$ refers to a single, grand population mean which is the same for all groups, and $\\mu_k$ is the population mean for the $k$-th group. Up to this point we've been mostly interested in whether our data are best described in terms of a single grand mean (the null hypothesis) or in terms of different group-specific means (the alternative hypothesis). This makes sense, of course: that's actually the important research question! However, all of our testing procedures have -- implicitly -- relied on a specific assumption about the residuals, $\\epsilon_{ik}$, namely that\n",

    "- **_Normality_**. The residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. [As we saw](shapiro), we can assess this by looking at QQ plots or running a Shapiro-Wilk test. I'll talk about this in an ANOVA context [below](anovanormality). \n",
    "- **_Homogeneity of variance_**. Notice that we've only got the one value for the population standard deviation (i.e., $\\sigma$), rather than allowing each group to have it's own value (i.e., $\\sigma_k$). This is referred to as the homogeneity of variance (sometimes called homoscedasticity) assumption. ANOVA assumes that the population standard deviation is the same for all groups. We'll talk about this [extensively](levene). \n",
    "- **_Independence_**. The independence assumption is a little trickier. What it basically means is that, knowing one residual tells you nothing about any other residual. All of the $\\epsilon_{ik}$ values are assumed to have been generated without any \"regard for\" or \"relationship to\" any of the other ones. There's not an obvious or simple way to test for this, but there are some situations that are clear violations of this: for instance, if you have a repeated-measures design, where each participant in your study appears in more than one condition, then independence doesn't hold; there's a special relationship between some observations... namely those that correspond to the same person! When that happens, you need to use something like repeated measures ANOVA. I don't currently talk about repeated measures ANOVA in this book, but it will be included in later versions, if I get [around to it](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/round_tuit).\n",

And our null hypothesis is that all groups have the same variance; that is, the same overall deviations from the group means! So, the null hypothesis in a Levene's test is that the population means of $Z$ are identical for all groups. Hm. So what we need now is a statistical test of the null hypothesis that all group means are identical. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, that's what ANOVA is... and so all that the Levene's test does is run an ANOVA on the new variable $Z_{ik}$. Done.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example, the homogeneity of variance assumption turned out to be a pretty safe one: the Levene test came back non-significant, so we probably don't need to worry. However, in real life we aren't always that lucky. How do we save our ANOVA when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated? If you recall from our discussion of $t$-tests, we've seen this problem before. The Student $t$-test assumes equal variances, so the solution was to use the Welch $t$-test, which does not. In fact, Welch {cite}`Welch1951` also showed how we can solve this problem for ANOVA too (the **_Welch one-way test_**). It's implemented in `pingouin` using the `welch_anova` function:"

    "## Removing the normality assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how to check for normality, we are led naturally to ask what we can do to address violations of normality. In the context of a one-way ANOVA, the easiest solution is probably to switch to a non-parametric test (i.e., one that doesn't rely on any particular assumption about the kind of distribution involved). We've seen non-parametric tests [before](wilcox): when you only have two groups, the Wilcoxon test provides the non-parametric alternative that you need. When you've got three or more groups, you can use the **_Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test_** {cite}`KruskalWallis1952`. So that's the test we'll talk about next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kruskal-Wallis test is surprisingly similar to ANOVA, in some ways. In ANOVA, we started with $Y_{ik}$, the value of the outcome variable for the $i$th person in the $k$th group. For the Kruskal-Wallis test, what we'll do is rank order all of these $Y_{ik}$ values, and conduct our analysis on the ranked data. So let's let $R_{ik}$ refer to the ranking given to the $i$th member of the $k$th group. Now, let's calculate $\\bar{R}_k$, the average rank given to observations in the $k$th group:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{R}_k = \\frac{1}{N_K} \\sum_{i} R_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and let's also calculate $\\bar{R}$, the grand mean rank:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{k} R_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've done this, we can calculate the squared deviations from the grand mean rank $\\bar{R}$. When we do this for the individual scores -- i.e., if we calculate $(R_{ik} - \\bar{R})^2$ -- what we have is a \"nonparametric\" measure of how far the $ik$-th observation deviates from the grand mean rank. When we calculate the squared deviation of the group means from the grand means -- i.e., if we calculate $(\\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2$ -- then what we have is a nonparametric measure of how much the *group* deviates from the grand mean rank. With this in mind, let's follow the same logic that we did with ANOVA, and define our *ranked* sums of squares measures in much the same way that we did earlier. First, we have our \"total ranked sums of squares\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{RSS}_{tot} = \\sum_k \\sum_i ( R_{ik} - \\bar{R} )^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can define the \"between groups ranked sums of squares\" like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "\\mbox{RSS}_{b} &=& \\sum_k \\sum_i ( \\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2 \\\\\n",
    "&=& \\sum_k N_k ( \\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2 \n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the null hypothesis is true and there are no true group differences at all, you'd expect the between group rank sums $\\mbox{RSS}_{b}$ to be very small, much smaller than the total rank sums $\\mbox{RSS}_{tot}$. Qualitatively this is very much the same as what we found when we went about constructing the ANOVA $F$-statistic; but for technical reasons the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, usually denoted $K$, is constructed in a slightly different way: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K = (N - 1) \\times \\frac{\\mbox{RSS}_b}{\\mbox{RSS}_{tot}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and, if the null hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of $K$ is *approximately* chi-square with $G-1$ degrees of freedom (where $G$ is the number of groups). The larger the value of $K$, the less consistent the data are with null hypothesis, so this is a one-sided test: we reject $H_0$ when $K$ is sufficiently large."

    "### Additional details\n",
    "\n",
    "The description in the previous section illustrates the logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test. At a conceptual level, this is the right way to think about how the test works. However, from a purely mathematical perspective it's needlessly complicated. I won't show you the derivation, but you can use a bit of algebraic jiggery-pokery[^notejig] to show that the equation for $K$ can be rewritten as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K = \\frac{12}{N(N-1)} \\sum_k N_k {\\bar{R}_k}^2    -  3(N+1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's this last equation that you sometimes see given for $K$. This is way easier to calculate than the version I described in the previous section, it's just that it's totally meaningless to actual humans. It's probably best to think of $K$ the way I described it earlier... as an analogue of ANOVA based on ranks. But keep in mind that the test statistic that gets calculated ends up with a rather different look to it than the one we used for our original ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, there's more! Dear lord, why is there always *more*? The story I've told so far is only actually true when there are no ties in the raw data. That is, if there are no two observations that have exactly the same value. If there *are* ties, then we have to introduce a correction factor to these calculations. At this point I'm assuming that even the most diligent reader has stopped caring (or at least formed the opinion that the tie-correction factor is something that doesn't require their immediate attention). So I'll very quickly tell you how it's calculated, and omit the tedious details about *why* it's done this way. Suppose we construct a frequency table for the raw data, and let $f_j$ be the number of observations that have the $j$-th unique value. This might sound a bit abstract, so here's the Python code showing a concrete example:"

    "\n",
    "[^note2]: In a later versions I'm intending to expand on this. But because I'm writing in a rush, and am already over my deadlines, I'll just briefly note that if you read ahead to the chapter on [factorial anovas](anova2) and look at how the \"treatment effect\" at level $k$ of a factor is defined in terms of the $\\alpha_k$ values (check out the section on [interactions](interactions)), it turns out that $Q$ refers to a weighted mean of the squared treatment effects, $Q=(\\sum_{k=1}^G N_k\\alpha_k^2)/(G-1)$.\n",

I do talk about this situation [later in the book](plannedcomparisons)), but for now I want to keep things simple.\n",
